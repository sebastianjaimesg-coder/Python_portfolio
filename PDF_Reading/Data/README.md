# Attachments Folder

This folder is intended to store **raw invoice files (input data)** used by the Python scripts.  
For privacy reasons, real invoices are **not included** in this public repository.  

Instead, you may place your own files here to test the pipeline.  
Expected format: Excel files (.xlsx) with user consumption and billing data.
